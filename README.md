# Design:

duration 16 min: 2 x 4 of each condition (for loop of list of conditions)
(for loop of blocks)

while block running, present circle with pos randomly determined
circle diameter gets reduced as a % of timer and total timer time, freezes and turns green if caught in time

# How to make it executable:

1. make sure there is the file exp-hemiPVT
2. run `code ~/.bashrc` in terminal
3. add at the bottom: `export PATH=~/Projects/hemi-pvt/:$PATH`

Then from a new terminal, you can run directly `exp-hemiPVT` and it starts!

# TODO: apply to pvt

# Notes:

unlike with countdown, less motivation to improve score
